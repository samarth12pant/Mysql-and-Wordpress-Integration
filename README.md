# Mysql-and-Wordpress-Integration
In this project Mysql and wordpress are connected and a website(basic) is built  of wordpress and this all is done using container technology called Docker.
Docker was chosen as it allows very fast launchinf of any OS(typically in2 to 3 seconds) so this s benefecial for nayone who wants to launch a wordpress website ith a database to store the data in it.
